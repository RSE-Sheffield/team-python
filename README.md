# Team Python üêç

Team Python is a group for learning Python hosted at The University of Sheffield, and
facilitated by the Research Software Engineering Team.

Currently we don't have a regular meeting but will get one organised soon.

We use [a project board][project-board] to track the topics - feel free to add topics you'd like to discuss in future.

If you have problems, e-mail d.wilby@sheffield.ac.uk

## Slack
Currently, we can talk python on the #team-python channel of the RSE-UoS slack workspace, for which details are available at: <https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/slack>


## Deciding topics for discussion
We'll decide topics for discussion at team python meets using democracy.
Discussion topics as issues can be sorted by how many :+1: upvotes they have [by using this link](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/team-python/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).

### Adding :heavy_plus_sign:
Either:
1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/team-python/issues/new/choose)
2. On the [project board][project-board] add your issue to the "Topics Wishlist" column.

Or:
1. On the [project board][project-board] at the top of the "Topics Wishlist" column, click `+` to create a new card.
2. Then on the new card, click `...` and `Convert to issue`.

### Voting :ballot_box:
On [issues][issues], give them a :+1: if you'd like to discuss them at a future meeting.
