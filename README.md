# Team Python üêç

Team Python is a group for learning Python hosted at The University of Sheffield, and
facilitated by the Research Software Engineering Team.

Currently we don't have a regular meeting but will get one organised soon.

We use [a project board](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/team-python/projects/1) to track the topics.

If you have problems, e-mail d.wilby@sheffield.ac.uk

## Slack
Currently, we can talk python on the #team-python channel of the RSE-UoS slack workspace, for which details are available at: <https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/slack>
