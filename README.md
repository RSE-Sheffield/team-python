# Team Python üêç

Team Python is a group for learning Python hosted at The University of Sheffield, and
facilitated by the Research Software Engineering Group.

We meet approximately every second Wednesday at 12:00 (local UK time).
If you have a The University of Sheffield Google account and you're logged in, you should be able to add yourself to the `team-python-group`: https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/#!forum/team-python-group.

We use [a projects board](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/team-python/projects/1) to track the meetings.

If you have problems, e-mail david.r.jones@sheffield.ac.uk
